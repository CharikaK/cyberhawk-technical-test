## The task
We've designed this task to try and give you the ability to show us what you can do and hopefully flex your technical and creative muscles. You can't show off too much here, show us you at your best and wow us!

We'd like you to build an application that will display an example wind farm, its turbines and their components. We'd like to be able to see components and their grades (measurement of damage/wear).

Don't worry about using real names for components or accurate looking data, we're more interested in how you structure the application and how you present the data.

We've used Laravel Sail as a foundation for this test, this should mean that getting an application up and running is quick and easy.

Don't be afraid of submitting incomplete code or code that isn't quite doing what you would like, just like your maths teacher, we like to see your working.
Just Document what you had hoped to achieve and your thoughts behind any unfinished code, so that we know what your plan was.

### Requirements
- Display a list of turbine inspections
- Each Turbine should have a number of components
- A component can be given a grade from 1 to 5 (1 being perfect and 5 being completely broken/missing)
- Use Laravel Models to represent the Entities in the task.

### Bonus Points
- Great UX/UI
- Use of React JS
- Use of Tailwind CSS
- Use of 3D
- Use of a web map technology in the display of the data
- Automated tests
- API Authentication
- Use of coding style guidelines (we use PSR-12 and AirBnb)
- Use of clear logical commits
- Specs/Plans/Designs
